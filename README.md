## Available Scripts

Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
